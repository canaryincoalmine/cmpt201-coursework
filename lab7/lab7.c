 * I have attempted to complete the lab, but the file for it is not available.
 * It says "This server could not verify that you are authorized to access the
 * document requested. Either you supplied the wrong credentials (e.g., bad
 * password), or your browser doesn't understand how to supply the credentials
 * required." I am sure that my credentials are correct, as I have them saved to
 * a password manager and they always work. If this lab can be fixed I would be
 * happy to do it, but for now I am submitting this to indicate that I tried.
